    """ Return softmax loss.  Note that for the purposes of this assignment,
    you don't need to worry about "nicely" scaling the numerical properties
    of the log-sum-exp computation, but can just compute this directly.

    Args:
        Z (np.ndarray[np.float32]): 2D numpy array of shape
            (batch_size, num_classes), containing the logit predictions for
            each class.
        y (np.ndarray[np.uint8]): 1D numpy array of shape (batch_size, )
            containing the true label of each example.

    Returns:
        Average softmax loss over the sample.
